pyGeoNet
This is the python implementation of GeoNet originally written in MATLAB
and maintained at https://sites.google.com/site/geonethome/

This version of GeoNet follows the same algorithm as GeoNet with a few
differences enumerated below.

The geotiff files i.e. lidar datasets are read using gdal libraries
